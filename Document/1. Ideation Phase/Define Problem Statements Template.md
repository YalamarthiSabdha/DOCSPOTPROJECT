# Define Problem Statement Template
## Project Title: DOC-APPOINTMENT – Doctor Appointment Booking System

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Situation
In today's healthcare system, patients face numerous challenges when trying to book appointments with doctors. Traditional methods such as phone calls, walk-ins, and paper-based scheduling are time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors. There is no centralized platform where patients can easily discover available doctors, check specializations, and book appointments digitally.

### The Problem
- Patients do not have a convenient digital platform to search for and book appointments with qualified doctors.
- Doctors lack a modern system to manage their appointments, patient information, and consultation schedules.
- Administrators have no centralized control to verify doctor credentials and manage users.
- There is no method for credential verification (MBBS certificate) before a doctor is listed.
- Patients have no way to provide feedback/ratings after appointments.

### Why It Matters
- Long waiting lines and manual appointment booking waste time for both patients and doctors.
- Without credential verification, patients may consult unqualified practitioners.
- Lack of patient feedback reduces the quality and accountability of healthcare services.

### Who is affected?
| Stakeholder | Problem Faced |
|---|---|

### Root Cause Analysis

## 3. Proposed Solution

Build a full-stack **Doctor Appointment Booking Single Page Application (SPA)** with:
- User registration with role-based access (User, Doctor, Admin)
- Doctor registration with MBBS certificate upload and admin approval
- Appointment booking with status tracking (Pending, Approved, Completed)
- Rating and review system post-appointment
- Admin dashboard for user and doctor management
- Notification system for key events

---

## 4. Innovation & Uniqueness

- **MBBS Certificate Upload**: Only doctors with valid uploaded certificates can apply.
- **Admin Approval Workflow**: All doctor profiles go through admin verification before being listed.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Users and doctors receive notifications for appointments and status changes.
- **Rating System**: After consultation, patients can rate and review doctors.
- **Role-Based Dashboard**: Separate views and features for User, Doctor, and Admin.

## 5. Expected Outcome

- Patients can find and book appointments with verified doctors in minutes.
- Doctors can manage their schedules and appointments digitally.
- Admins can ensure only qualified doctors are listed on the platform.
- Healthcare quality improves through patient feedback and ratings.
